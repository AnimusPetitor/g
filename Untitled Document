This is a Latin dictionary based on William Whitaker Words. -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whitaker%27s_Words

"The dictionary consists of about 39,000 entries, which would result in hundreds of thousands of variations, counting declensions and conjugations.[1]

Additionally, the dictionary contains prefixes and suffixes.[2]
In comparison, the Oxford Latin Dictionary, considered to be the most complete Latin lexicon published in the English language, has about 34,000 entries, excluding proper names.[3] The Oxford Latin Dictionary has fewer entries because it only contains entries from Classical Latin, whereas Words contains words from many time periods."
